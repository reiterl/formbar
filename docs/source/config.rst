.. _form_config:

Form configuration
******************
The form will be configured using a XML definition. The configuration is
basically splitted into two parts:

1. The definition of the datamodel in the *source* directive.
2. Definition and Layout of forms in *forms*.

The basic form configuration looks like this::

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
        <configuration>
           <source>
           <!-- Define different entity types -->
           </source>
           <form>
           <!-- Define and layout a form -->
           </form>
           <snippet>
           <!-- Container holdig parts of a form definition -->
           </snippet>
        </configuration>

The :ref:`snippet` element is optional and just a helper.

Datamodel
=========
The ``source`` directive defines the :ref:`entity` are available in your
forms.  An entity is defined only once in the source section. It will get
referenced in the :ref:`form` directive later to build the forms.


.. _entity:

Entity
------
A :ref:`entity` is a field definition.
The entity is used to configure aspects of the *datamodel* the *layout*
and *behaviour* of the field in the form.

Here is an example of an entity definition::

    <entity id="f1" name="age" label="Age" type="integer" css="field" required="true">
        <renderer type="text"/>
        <help>This is a help text</help>
        <rule expr="$age ge 21" msg="Age must be greater than 21"/> 
        <validator src="a.b.external_validator" msg="Error message"/>
    </entity>

Entities can be marked as *required* or *desired*. Formed will generate
automatically a :ref:`rule`  for this field. Missing required fields will
trigger an error on form validation. Desired fields will trigger a warning.

Entities can be marked as *readonly*. Readonly fields are renderer as simple
text in the form displaying the current value of the field. Note, that
readonly fields are not sent on submission! If you need the value if the form
you will need to add an additional entity and render is with the hidden field
renderer.

Each entity can optional have a :ref:`renderer`, :ref:`rule` or :ref:`help`
element.

===========   ===========
Attribute     Description
===========   ===========
id            Used to refer to this entity in the form. Requiered. Must be unique.
name          Used as name attribute in the rendered field. Defines the name of this attribute in the model. Name of the field must only contain characters which are valid in context of your database. So better stay with [a-zA-Z0-9_]
label         The field will be rendered with this label.
number        A small number which is rendered in front of the label.
type          Defines the python datatype which will be used on deserialisation of the submitted value. Defines the datatype of the model. Possible values are ``string`` (default), ``text``, ``integer``, ``float``, ``date``, ``datetime``, ``email``, ``boolean``, ``time``, ``interval``, ``currency``.
css           Value will be rendered as class attribute in the rendered field.
expr          Expression which is used to calculate the value of the field.
value         Default value of the field. Supports expressions. The default value might get overwritten on rendering.
placeholder   Custom placeholder that overrides the default of a field. For now only usable for ``interval``.
readonly      Flag to indicate that the field should be rendered as readonly field. Default is ``false``.
required      Flag to indicate that the is a required field. Default is ``false``.
autofocus     Flag to mark the field to be focused on pageload. Only one field per form can be focused. Default is ``false``.
desired       Flag to indicate that the is a desired field. Default is ``false``.
tags          Comma separated list of tags for this field.
===========   ===========

Defaults
^^^^^^^^
You can set a default for the field in case there is no value for the
field. The default value can be set by using the ``value`` attribute of
the entity.

You can provide a default value by

1. Given in plain string value
2. Accessing an attribute of the SA mapped item. This supports dot
   separated attribute names of the item to access related items::

        ... value="$foo.bar.baz"

   "$" represents the current form item. So foo is an attribute of it and
   bar is an attribute of foo.

3. Using expressions. The default value can be calculated by using a
   expression::

        ... value="% date('today')"

   The expample will set the value to the current date.
   "%" is used to say formbar that the following string must be
   considered as an expression. The Expression will evaluated with the
   values of the current form item.

Options
-------
Options are used to define available options for a entity in case it is an selection. The options my be defined in different ways.

By defining every option per hand::

    <options>
        <option value="1">Foo</option>
        <option value="2">Bar</option>
        ...
        <option value="99">Baz</option>
    </options>

By setting the value attribute of the options. This should be the name of an attribute of the item which is used to get the available options::

    <options value=""/>

By not defining options at all and letting the library load the options for you based on the entity name.

=========   ===========
Attribute   Description
=========   ===========
value       Optional. Name of an attribute of the item which will provide a list of items used for the options.
=========   ===========


.. _rule:

Rule
----
Rules are used to validate data in the form. Formed does already some basic
validated on the submitted data depending on the configured data type in the
:ref:`entity`. These checks are often already sufficient for most basic forms.

If you need more validation rules can be used to define additional checks.
There are two types of rules. Rules which triggers errors, and rules which
trigger a warning if the evaluation of the rule fails.

Rules are evaluated in the process of validation the submitted data. On
validation formed will collect warning and errors and will rerender the form
displaying them. If the form has errors the validation fails. Warnings are ok
for validation.

Validation of rules can be done in differen modes. Rules with the mode ``pre``
are evaluation before the deserialisation of the submitted value occurs into
the python data type of the field. In contrast rules with mode ``post`` are
evaluation after the deserialisation happened.

Here is a example rule::

        <rule expr="$age ge 21" msg="Age must be greater than 21" mode="post" triggers="warning"/>

Here you can see a example rule. The rule will check the value of field "age"
($age) is greater or equal that the value 21. The rule is evaluated in post
mode. And will trigger a warning if the evaluation fails.

=========   ===========
Attribute   Description
=========   ===========
expr        Expression which is used to validate the value if the field.
msg         The message which is displayed if the evaluation of the rule fails.
mode        Point in validation when this rules gets evaluations. ``post`` (default) means after the deserialisation of the value and ``pre`` is before deserialisation.
triggers    Flag which defines which type of message a the rule will trigger if the evaluation fails. Be be ``error`` (default) or ``warning``.
=========   ===========

.. _validator:

Validator
---------
A validator defines an external validator. Those validators are usally
used if the validation become more complex or it is just not possible to
express the rule with a :ref:`rule` You can define a validator in the
form configuration in a similar way like defining rules for an entity::

            <validator src="a.b.external_validator" msg="Error message"/>

=========   ===========
Attribute   Description
=========   ===========
src         The *src* attribute is the modul path to the callable. The path is used to import the validator dynamically at runtime.
msg         The message which is displayed if the evaluation of the validation fails.
=========   ===========

See :ref:`external_validator` for more details, how to write such a
validator. The external validator will be called with the following
params::

    field   -> Name of the field the validator belongs to
    data    -> Data of the form as a dictionary
    context -> The current form instance. The form provides access to further resources like the request form._request or the current item form._item. See form model for more details.

.. _help:

Help
----
The help block can be used to add some information to the field for the user.
You can also define some HTML content for the help block to add links to
external ressources for example::

  <help display="text"><html>HTML content must be wrapped in <i>html</i>
  tags></html></help>

To be able to use the HTML content the content of the help element must
be wrapped in a html tag. But you can leave this out in case you just
have ordinary text content.

=========   ===========
Attribute   Description
=========   ===========
display     Defines how and where to display the information on the field. Can be ``tooltip`` (default) or ``text``.
=========   ===========

Depending on the display attribute of the help the information is either shown
as tooltip next to the label of the field or below the field as normal text.

.. _renderer:

Renderer
--------
The renderer directive can be used to configure an alternative renderer to be
used to render the field.

The default renderer is chosen depending on the datatype of the field and is a
textfield for almost all normal datatypes. On relations (in SQLAlchemy mapped
items) a selection field is used for the relations

============ ===========
Attribute    Description
============ ===========
type         Type of the renderer. See :ref:`formbar_renderers`
indent       Style of indent of input elements. If set the field elements and help texts under the label will get an indent. This only applies if the label position is set to top. Defaults to no indent. Possible values are `empty`, `symbol` and `number`, `bg`. The style can be combined with the further attributes to define additional styling aspects linke border and width of the indent. Use `bordered` to get some additional visual indication of the indent and `sm`, `md`, `lg` to define the size of the indention.
============ ===========

There are different types of :ref:`formbar_renderers` available coming with formed. You
can define which renderer will be used by setting the *type* attribute::

        <renderer type="checkbox" indent="number-borderd-lg"/>

But it is very easy to write your own custom renderer. See
:ref:`custom_renderer` for more details on writing custom renderes and
:ref:`conf_custom_renderer` on how to use them for rendering in your form.

Label
^^^^^
The lable tag can be used to have more options to configure the rendering
of the fields label. The label tag can be seen as a configuration
option of the renderer::

        <renderer>
            <label position="left" align="right" width="4"/>
            ...
        </renderer>

The label tag is only used to configure the position, alignment and the
width of the label. The text of the label is still configured in the
entitiy.

==========   ===========
Attribute    Description
==========   ===========
position     The position of the label realtive to the field element. Can be "left", "top", "right". Defaults to "top".
align        The alignment of the text in the label. This only applies for labels with position set to "left" or "right". Can be "left" and "right". Defaults to "left".
width        The width of the label in cols. The whole field including the label can be deived into 12 cols. If the label has e.g 4 cols the field will automatically take the remaining 8 cols. This only applies for labels with position set to "left" or "right".
number       The position of the small number (if set) in the label. Can be `left` or `right` Defaults to `left`.
background   Optional if set to true the label will get a light backgroud color.
==========   ===========

.. _layout:

Layout
======
The form directive is the place where the form definition and layout happens.

.. hint::
   You can define more than one form in one configuration. This gets very
   handy if you want to define different forms for differen purposes. Example:
   You have a form to create a new item with a reduced set of fields. Another
   form which has all fields included can be used to edit the item.

Forms are built by using references to the defined entities packed in some
layout directives::

        <form id="create" css="fooish" autocomplete="off" method="POST" action="" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        ...
        </form>



============   ===========
Attribute      Description
============   ===========
id             Unique id of the field.
css            The attribute will be added to the *class* attribute of the form.
autocomplete   Flag to indicate if the form should be autocompleted by the browser. Defaults to ``on``.
method         HTTP method used to submit the data. Defaults to POST.
action         URL where is submitted data is sent to. Default to the current URL.
enctype        Encrytion used while sending the data. Defaults to ``application/x-www-form-urlencoded``. Use ``multipart/form-data`` if you plan to submit file uploads.
============   ===========

Buttons
-------
Optional directive within the form tag to configure custom buttons for the
form. If not defined the default Submit Button is renderered. If
the form has pages than an additional "Save and proceed" button is rendered.::

        <buttons>
          <button type="submit" value="delete" name="_submit" class="warning" icon="glyphicon glyphicon-delete">Delete</button>
          ...
        </buttons>

Buttons are rendererd at the bottom of the form element.
The first button in the definition will be the first button on the left side.

============   ===========
Attribute      Description
============   ===========
type           Optional. Type of action the button will trigger on the form (submit, reset). Defaults to ``submit``
value          Optional. Value which is submitted in the form. Defaults to the buttons text.
name           Optional. Name under which the value will be available in the submitted data Defaults to ``_$type``.
class          Optional. CSS class which will be added to the button.
icon           Optional. Definition of glyphicons which will be displayed before the buttons label.
ignore         Optional. If set the button will be ignored on rendering.  This can be used to ignore rendering of buttons at all in a specific form.
============   ===========

Page
----
Use pages if you want to divide your form into multiple pages. Pages are
rendered as a separate outline of the form on the left site to navigate
through the form pages.

Row, Col
--------
Used to layout the form::

        <row>
          <col></col>
          <col></col>
        </row>
        <row>
          <col width="8"></col>
          <col width="2"></col>
          <col width="2"></col>
        </row>

The form is divided into 12 virtual cols. The width of each col is calculated
automatically. A single in a row will have the full width of 12. For 2 cols in
a row each col will have a width of 6 cols. If you define 3 cols each col will
have a width of 4 and so on.

You can alternatively define the *width* of the col. If you provide the width of
the col you need to take care that the sum of all cols in the row is 12 to not
mess up the layout.

Rows and cols can be mixed. So rows can be in cols again.

============   ===========
Attribute      Description
============   ===========
width          Width of the col (1-12).
============   ===========

Sections
--------
Sections can be used to divide a page in logical sections. This is very
similar to the fieldsets::

        <section label="1. Section">
          <subsection label="1.1 Subsection">
            <row>
              <col></col>
              <col></col>
            </row>
            <subsubsection label="1.1.1 Subsubsection">
                ...
            </subsubsection>
          </subsection>
        </section>

Every section will genereate a HTML header tag. Formbar supports up to three
levels of sections.


============   ===========
Attribute      Description
============   ===========
label          Label of the fieldset rendered as header.
============   ===========

Fieldset
--------
A fieldset can be used to group fields into a logical unit a fieldset will
have a label which is rendered as a heading above the first field of the
fieldset.  Fieldsets can be nested to model some kind of hierarchy. Formbar
supports up to three levels. The size of the font in the fieldset legend will
be reduced a littlebit on every level.::


        <fieldset label="1. Foo">
        ...
          <fieldset label="1.1 Bar">
            <row>
              <col></col>
              <col></col>
            </row>
          <fieldset>
        <fieldset>

A fieldset can include almost all other directives.


============   ===========
Attribute      Description
============   ===========
label          Label of the fieldset rendered as header.
============   ===========

Text
----
Text can be used to add some simple text information in the form. It does not
support any formatting of the text. If you need more formatting please use the
html renderer::

      <row>
        <col><text>Hello I'm Text</text></col>
        <col><text>Hello I'm a seconds Text</text></col>
      </row>


============   ===========
Attribute      Description
============   ===========
color          Color of the text. Possible options: "muted", "warning", "danger", "info", "primary", "success". Defaults to no change of the current text color.
bg             Color of the background. Possible options: "warning", "danger", "info", "primary", "success". Defaults to render no background.
em             Emphasis of the text. Possible options: "strong", "small", "em" (italic). Defaults to no emphasis.
============   ===========

Table
-----
.. important::
   Tables should not be used to layout the form!

Tables can be used to arrange your fields in a tabuluar form. This becomes
handy in some situations e.g to build your own widget::

        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Criteria</th>
            <th>Male</th>
            <th>Female</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td width="70%">Number of humans in the world</td>
            <td><field ref="men"/></td>
            <td><field ref="women"/></td>
            <td><field ref="total"/></td>
          </tr>
        </table>

Tables are usually used in the same way as :ref:`field` is used. Tables will
take 100% of the available space. You can set the ``width`` attribute of the
<td> field to configure the width of the columns. The width of the
column can be set to % or pixel.

The following attributes are supported for the ``td`` and ``th`` tags of the
table: ``width``, ``class`` , ``rowspan``, ``colspan``.

HTML
----
The html directive is used to insert custom html code. This is usefull if you
want to render generic text sections icluding lists or other markup elements
linke images. Images will need a external source for the image file.::

        <html>
         <ul style="padding:15px">
           <li>List item 1</li>
           <li>List item 2</li>
           <li>List item 3</li>
         </ul>
        </html>

The content of the html directive will be rendererd as defined so you are free
to include whatever you want.

.. _field:

Field
-----
A field in the form. The field only references an :ref:`Entity`::

        <field ref="f1"/>

============   ===========
Attribute      Description
============   ===========
ref            id if the referenced :ref:`Entity`.
============   ===========


Conditional
-----------
Conditional can be used to hide, or render form elements like fields,
tables, fieldsets and text elements within the conditional as readonly
elements.

If the condition must evaluate to true or false. If true, the elements are
rendered normal. If the condition is false the effect is determined by the
type of the conditional. On default the elements will be hidden completely. As
alternative you can set the type of the conditional to "readonly". Currently
only the type "readonly" are supported. Expample::

        <if type="readonly" expr="$fieldname == 4">
            <field ref="r1"/>
        </if>

In the example above the referenced field will be shown if the field in the
form with the name "fieldname" has the value of 4. Else the element will
be set to readonly and the element will have a lowered opacity.

============   ===========
Attribute      Description
============   ===========
type           Effect of the conditional if the condition evaluates to false.  Defaults to ``hidden``.
expr           The expression which will be evaluated.
static         Flag disable dynamic clientsided evaluation of the conditional. Defaults to ``false``.
reset-value    If `true` than the value of all fields with in the conditional will be removed . Defaults to ``false``.
============   ===========

Conditionals are evaluated using JavaScript on the client side. Formbar also
needs to evaluate the conditional internal on validation to determine which
values will be taken into account while validating. As result validation rules
will not be applied for "hidden" fields.

.. _snippet:

Snippet
-------
Snippets are reusable parts of your form definiton. Snippets allow you to
define parts of the form only once and use them in multiple forms.
Example: If you want to use the same form to create and edit than you can
define the form in a snippet and use it in the create and edit form::

        <form id="foo">
          <snippet ref="s1"/>
        </form>
        <form id="bar">
          <snippet ref="s1"/>
        </form>
        <snippet id="s1">
          <row>...</row>
        </snippet>

Snippet needs to be in a form to get rendered. Snippets can reference other
snippets using the ``ref`` attribute. Snippets are of great help if you want
to reduced the effort of rearranging groups of elements in the form. But on
the other side the can make the form quite complicated if you use them too
much. Use them with care.

============   ===========
Attribute      Description
============   ===========
id             Unique id of the snippet
ref            References the snippet with id.
============   ===========

.. _formbar_renderers:

Renderers
=========
Usually the renderer for a field is chosen automatically from formbar based on
the datatype. But you can define an alternative renderer. Below you can the
the available default renderers in ringo. If you need custom renderers the
refer to :ref:`custom_renderer` 

Textarea
--------
Use this renderer if you want to render the field as a textfield::

        <renderer type="textarea" rows="20"/>

=========   ===========
Attribute   Description
=========   ===========
rows        Number of rows of the texteare. Default is 3.
maxlength   Number of chars "allowed". If set a small indicator below the textarea is show indicating how many chars are left.  Please note that this does **not** triggers any rules. Rules to enforce this maxlength must be defined too.
=========   ===========

Infofield
---------
The info field renderer is used to render the value of the entity as
textual information. This renderer is usually used to display calculated
values of the entity. See the ``expr`` attribute of the :ref:`Entity`. If you
simply want to display a static value comming from on of the items attribute
you can also use the ``value`` attribute.
Appearance is same as a readonly field::

        <renderer type="infofield"/>

============   ===========
Attribute      Description
============   ===========
showrawvalue   If set to true the info field will return the "raw" value if the field which whithout any exapandation or conversion of the value. This becomes handy for relations if you want to show the related item instead of just its id. Default is false.
============   ===========

.. _selection:

Selection
---------
The selection renderer is used to render a selection list fields. Such a field
is capable to select multiple options. The renderer defines also the options
which should be available in the dropdown menu. For SQLAlchemy mapped items
the options are automatically determined from the underlying data model::

        <entity>
          <renderer type="selection"/>
          <!-- Note, that the options are part of the entity! -->
          <options>
             <option value="1">Option 1</option>
             <option value="2">Option 2</option>
             <option value="3">Option 3</option>
          </options>
        </entity>

=============== ===========
Attribute       Description
=============== ===========
filter          Expression which must evaluate to True if the option should be shown in the Dropdown.
remove_filtered Flag "true/false" to indicate that filtered items should not be rendered at all. On default filtered items will only be hidden and selection is still present.
sort            If set to "true" than the options will be alphabetically sorted. Defaults to no sorting.
sortorder       If set to "desc" the sorting will be descending (reversed) order. Default is ascending sorting.
=============== ===========

Filtering can be done by defining a expression in the filter attribute. This
expression is later evaluated by the rule system of formbar. The expression
must evaluate to true and is evaluated for every option. The expression uses a
two special variables begining with 

1. ``%``.  Variables beginning with % marks the options of the
   selection. ``%attr`` will access a attribute named 'attr' in the
   option. A single ``%`` can be used on userdefined options to access
   the value of the option. For SQLAlchemy based options comming from
   the database ``%`` can be used to access a attribute of the option.
   E.g '%id' will access the id attribute of the option.  The variable
   will be replaced by the value of the attribute of the current item in
   the option for every option before evaluating.

2. ``@``. Varaible beginning with @ marks the name of an attribute of
the parents form item.

3. ``$``. Varaible beginning with $ marks the name of field in the form.

All variables support accessing related items through the dot-syntax::
        
        <renderer type="selection" filter="%foo eq @bar.baz">

.. _dropdown:

Dropdown
--------
The dropdown renderer is used to render dropdown fields. The renderer defines
also the options which should be available in the dropdown menu. For
SQLAlchemy mapped items the options are automatically determined from the
underlying data model::

        <entity>
           <renderer type="dropdown"/>
           <options>
              <option value="1">Option 1</option>
              <option value="2">Option 2</option>
              <option value="3">Option 3</option>
           </options>
        </entity>

=============== ===========
Attribute       Description
=============== ===========
filter          Expression which must evaluate to True if the option should be shown in the Dropdown.
remove_filtered Flag "true/false" to indicate that filtered items should not be rendered at all. On default filtered items will only be hidden and selection is still present.
sort            If set to "true" than the options will be alphabetically sorted. Defaults to no sorting.
sortorder       If set to "desc" the sorting will be descending (reversed) order. Default is ascending sorting.
=============== ===========

.. note::
   Filtering is only possible for SQLAlchemy mapped items.

See filtering section of the :ref:`selection` renderer.

Radio
-----
The radio renderer is used to render radio fields based on the given options.
Such a field is capable to select only one option. For SQLAlchemy mapped
items the options are automatically determined from the underlying data
model. The radionfields will be aligned in a horizontal row::

        <entity>
          <renderer type="radio"/>
          <options>
             <option value="1">Option 1</option>
             <option value="2">Option 2</option>
             <option value="3">Option 3</option>
          </options>
        </entity>

=============== ===========
Attribute       Description
=============== ===========
filter          Expression which must evaluate to True if the option shoul be shown in the Dropdown.
align           Alignment of the checkboxes. Can be "vertical" or "horizontal". Defaults to "horizontal".
sort            If set to "true" than the options will be alphabetically sorted. Defaults to no sorting.
sortorder       If set to "desc" the sorting will be descending (reversed) order. Default is ascending sorting.
selected        If set the renderer will select the n-th entry from the options (0 ist first, -1 is las, etc). The entry will only be seleced if the entity does **not** have a value or a default value. Default is to not select an entry.
=============== ===========

See filtering section of the :ref:`dropdown` renderer.

Checkbox
--------
The checkbox renderer is used to render checkbox fields based on the given options.
Such a field is capable to multiple options. For SQLAlchemy mapped
items the options are automatically determined from the underlying data
model. The checkboxes will be aligned in a horizontal row::

        <entity>
          <renderer type="checkbox"/>
          <options>
             <option value="1">Option 1</option>
             <option value="2">Option 2</option>
             <option value="3">Option 3</option>
          </options>
        </entity>


=============== ===========
Attribute       Description
=============== ===========

remove_filtered Flag "true/false" to indicate that filtered items should not be rendered at all. On default filtered items will only be hidden and selection is still present.
align           Alignment of the checkboxes. Can be "vertical" or "horizontal". Defaults to "horizontal".
sort            If set to "true" than the options will be alphabetically sorted. Defaults to no sorting.
sortorder       If set to "desc" the sorting will be descending (reversed) order. Default is ascending sorting.
=============== ===========

See filtering section of the :ref:`dropdown` renderer.

Textoption
----------
A textoption field is basically a selection field which can be used to set
multible values. This type of renderer is often used for adding `tags`. In a
textoption field the values can be entered in a textfield. The textfield has
support for autocompletion which offers the available options::

        <entity>
          <renderer type="textoption"/>
          <options>
             <option value="1">Option 1</option>
             <option value="2">Option 2</option>
             <option value="3">Option 3</option>
          </options>
        </entity>

In this example the user can enter "Op" in the textfield and the
autocompletion will offer all options beginning with "Op". If the users
selects on or more options, the will be set in the background
and submitted on form submission.

sortorder       If set to "desc" the sorting will be descending (reversed) order. Default is ascending sorting.
=============== ===========

See filtering section of the :ref:`dropdown` renderer.

Datepicker
----------
The datepicker renderer has some Javascript functionality which lets the used
pick the date from a calender. It also only allows valid date entries per
keyboard::

        <renderer type="datepicker"/>

Password
--------
The password renderer renderes a password field which hides the users input::

        <renderer type="password"/>


Hidden
------
The hidden field renderer is used to render a hidden field for the entity. No
labels, helptexts or error messages will be renderer. The hidden field will
also take care on relations for SQLAlchemy mapped items::

        <renderer type="hidden"/>

Currency
--------
The currency renderer renderer is used to render a currency field for
the entity. The icon default to Euro (€), but can be changed by using a
differend icon from the glyphicons icon set.::

        <renderer type="currency" icon="glyphicons-euro"/>

Html
----
The html renderer is used to render custom html code. This is usefull if you
want to render generic text sections or insert images. Images will need a
external source for the image file. The html renderer will render Javascript
, Stylesheets and HTML code::

        <renderer type="html">
         <div>
           <p>You can include all valid html including images, lists etc.</p>
           <p><strong>Warning:</strong>Also JS can be included.</p>
         </div>
        </renderer>

Your custom code should be wrapped into a empty div node. Otherwise only the
first child node of the renderer will be rendererd.
The entity only needs the id attribute. If a label is provided, the label
will be uses as some kind of header to the html part.

.. warning::
   Use this renderer with caution as it may introduce a large security hole if
   users inject malicious javascript code into the form using the html renderer.

.. _form:

FormbarFormEditor
-----------------
Use this renderer if you want to render a editor for formbar forms. The
Editor will have a preview window which shows the result of the
rendering of the form. If rendering fails, the preview will show the
errors which happened while rendering::

        <renderer type="formbareditor" url="foo/bar" rows="20"/>

=========   ===========
Attribute   Description
=========   ===========
rows        Number of rows of the textarea. Default is 3.
url         URL which is called to renderer the form.
=========   ===========

.. _metadata:

Metadata (Specification)
========================
You can add add metadata information to ``configuration``, ``entity``,
``option``, ``renderer``, ``rule``, ``form``, ``snippet`` elements of the
form.

Metadata can be used to build some kind of specification of the form. This
data can be used by the ``formspec.py`` command to generate a specification of
the form.

Every metadata block will look like this::

    <metadata>
        <meta attrib="example" date="YYYYMMDD"></meta>
    </metadata>

=========   ===========
Attribute   Description
=========   ===========
attrib      Classification of the metaattribute. 
label       Optional. Used for the `free` classification to provide a label.
date        Date of the entry
=========   ===========

The following classification are available: 

`change`
    Documentation of change made to the element (may appear multiple times)

`comment`
    Additional comments to the element. 

    Comments which are applicable to the whole document which will be printed
    at the top of the RST document (may appear multiple times).

`desc`
    General plain-language description of the element(unique).

`free`
    Required additional attributes: ``label``

    General purpose metadata field which allows custom labels (may appear
    multiple times).

`intro`
    An introductory text applicable to the whole document which will be printed
    at the top of the RST document (unique).


All meta items must contain a ``date`` attribute in the format ``YYYYMMDD``.

Entities
--------

Example::

        <entity>
          <metadata>
            <meta attrib="change" date="20150820">Customer request: Changed label of field to Foo</meta>
            <meta attrib="change" date="20150826">Customer request: Changed label of field to Bar</meta>
          </metadata>
        </entity>

Rules
-----

Example::

        <entity>
          <rule>
            <metadata>
              <meta attrib="desc" date="20150820">Is True when Foo is larger than Bar</meta>
              <meta attrib="change" date="20150826">Customer request: Added rule to check value of Foo</meta>
            </metadata>
          </rule>
        </entity>

Document metadata (``<configuration>``/Root Metadata)
-----------------------------------------------------
The main ``<configuration>`` element may contain metadata (*root metadata*)
which is relevant to the whole document.  This information will be formatted
as a preamble to the RST output

Example::

        <configuration>
          <metadata>
            <meta attrib="intro" date="20150820">This text will be rendererd as preamble.</meta>
            <meta attrib="comment" date="20150826">Adapted all labels to fullfill gender mainstreaming requirements.</meta>
          </metadata>
          <source>
           ...
          </source>
          ...
        </entity>

.. _custom_renderer:

Write custom renderes
=====================
Formbar makes it easy to create a custom renderer. All you need to to is
to overwrite the :class:`.FieldRenderer` class. In most cases you only
need to provide a new Template for your field which handles to main
rendering. As example see :class:`.InfoFieldRenderer` how to set a new
template.

.. _external_validator:

Write external validators
=========================
A external validator is a simple python callable of the following form::

    def external_validator(field, data, context=None):
        return 16 == data[field]

The value 'data' is the converted value dictionary of the form and
contains all values of the form. The value 'field' defines the name of
the field for which this validation belongs to and also determines on
which field the error message will be shown. The 'context' is optional
and can be anything additional which is needed for the validation.

The function should return True in case the validation succeeds or either
return False or raise an :class:`.ValidationException` in case of validation
errors. If the method
raises an exception the message of the exception will be used as error
message. The validator can be added in two differen ways.

In the formconfig
-----------------
See :ref:`validator` for more details.

In the view
------------
Another way to add validator to the form is to add the form in the view after
the form has been initialized::

        validator = Validator('fieldname',
                              'Error message',
                              external_validator)
        self.form.add_validator(validator)

.. _includes:

Includes
========
.. versionadded:: 0.17.0
Includes are used to include the content of a different file into the current
configuration. The included file may contain :ref:`entity` definition or parts
of the :ref:`layout` like a single :ref:`snippet`. The include will be
replaced with the content of the of the included file.

A include can be placed at any location of the form configuration and looks
like this::

        <include src="path/to/form/config.xml"/>

=============   ===========
Attribute       Description
=============   ===========
src             Location of the configuration file which should be included
element         Only include a single element form the XML file defined in src. The element is referenced by its id.
entity-prefix   Prefix of the name of the entity fieldname
=============   ===========

The include file must be a valid XML file. The content of the include file can
be wrapped into a `configuration` tag::

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
        <configuration>
                ... Content ...
        </configuration>

.. _supported_urls:

.. rubric:: Supported URL formats

The location of the file can be defined in three ways:

1. As a path relatice to the current XML file.
2. As a absoulte path (Path is begining with an "/").
3. Package relative. Example: *@foo/path/to/form/config.xml*. Formbar
   will evaluate the path to the package *foo* and replaces the
   packagage location with the @foo placeholder



Examples
--------
.. rubric:: Include options
Includes can be handy to outsource parts of the form definition into its own
file. This is especially useful when the outsourced parts are potentially
reused in multiple places. Think of a long list of options within a entity::

        <entity id="country" name="country" type="integer">
            <options>
                <include src="./countries.xml"/>
                <option value="4">Value 4</option>
            </option>
        </entity>

The include file looks like this::

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
        <configuration>
            <option value="1">Value 1</option>
            <option value="2">Value 2</option>
            <option value="3">Value 3</option>
        </configuration>

This way you can keep your form definition clean and short and maintain the
countries in a separate file.

.. _inheritance:

Inheritance
===========
.. versionadded:: 0.17.0
Inheritance can be used to build a form based on another parent form. The
inherited form will takeover all properties of the parent form, but can add or
modify properties.

An inherited form looks like a usual form, but adds a `inherits` attribute in
the `configuration` section::

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
        <configuration inherits="./parent.xml">
           <source>
           <!-- Add or modify entities -->
           </source>
           <form>
           <!-- Add or modify forms -->
           </form>
           <snippet>
           <!-- Add or modify snippets -->
           </snippet>
        </configuration>

The `source`, `form` and `snippet` section is optional and are only needed if
this section needs to be modified.

Inheritance can only be applied on elements in the form which have an `id`.
This is because the id is used to identify to elements in the parent form.

To overwrite an element of the parent form you need to add an element with the
same id in the inherited form. This will replace the element including all
attributes and subelements.

To add new elements, you simply need to at a new element with an id which
isn't already defined in the parent form. The new element will be appended at
the end of the related section/part of the form.

Removing elements in the inherited form is not supported.

See :ref:`supported URL formats <supported_urls>` for more information on how to refer to the
inherited file.
